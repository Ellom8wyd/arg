        The Art of Encoding

    <chapter title="What will we do in this chapter?" id="what-will-we-do-in-this-chapter">
        <p>In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the world of encoding, exploring various techniques beyond Base64.
            Encoding is the process of converting data into a specific format that can be easily transmitted or stored,
            while decoding is the reverse process of converting encoded data back to its original form. Understanding
            different encoding methods and their applications can be a valuable skill in the world of puzzles and
            ARGs.</p>
